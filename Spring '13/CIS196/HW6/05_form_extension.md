## Add some additional form fields that make sense in your app

Include at least one of:

* `collection_select`
* `radio_button`
* `check_box`

Submit the URLs for the deployed app on Heroku as well as the files on github where you've added the form fields.

See http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html for reference.

## Include links between resources

Add `link_to` where appropriate so you can navigate between your resources.

Use the `_path` and `_url` helper functions and check `rake routes` if something doesn't match up.

## Include some CSS (or a CSS framework) project look a bit nicer if you haven't already
